project 2	memory management

description	This project is about writing a memory management system in order to control a chunk of given memory.
		The way of controlling the memory is to manually allocate spaces on the given given memory by returing the address.
		There are four ways of managing the memory:
		
		First Fit:	whenever there is an request, return the first hole you find on the memory.
				I did this by a single for loop.

		Best Fit:	Whenever there is an request, return the smallest hole that can fit.
				I did this by a single for loop with a IF statement

		Worst Fit:	Whenever there is an request, return the biggest hole that can fit.
				I did this by a single for loop with a IF statement

		Buddy system:	Based on the first request, divide the chunk of memory by the power of 2
				First, I find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than the first memory request size,
				then I divide the chunck on memory I have based on it.
				The managing process other than that is considered "Best FIT"

Issue		There seems to be issues with the number of holes all the time, so I am not able to complete the whole project.
