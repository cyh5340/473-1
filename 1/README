issues:
	Failed to use linked list, so just replace it with struct array--- since there is at most 100 threads to be send in for testing
	Finding a partner that can code is hard; should've just follow own schedule and not to delay for whatever reason.
logic:
	FCFS:
		search for the least currentTime in the array and signal it
		(they were all put to wait in the loop)
	LRTF:
		search for the least remainingTime in the array and signal it
		(they were all put to wait in the loop)
	PBF:
		search for the least value in priority in the array and signal it
		(they were all put to wait in the loop)
